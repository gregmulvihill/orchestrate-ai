An orchestrated AI system for accelerating project development through self-improving infrastructure.

## Overview

Orchestrate-AI is designed as a self-improving infrastructure that rapidly iterates on both technology and business strategy. By establishing an early revenue stream, it aims to create a sustainable engine for growth, ensuring long-term success in the evolving AI landscape.

Orchestrate-AI is the top-level strategic component in a three-tier AI development ecosystem:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ORCHESTRATE-AI                                  │
│ (Strategic Orchestration & Business Logic)      │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ AUTOMATED-DEV-AGENTS                            │
│ (Tactical Task Execution & Agent Management)    │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ MULTI-TIERED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE                │
│ (Persistence, Context Preservation, Knowledge)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Role in the Ecosystem

Orchestrate-AI handles the high-level strategic concerns, including:
- Business strategy optimization
- Workflow automation
- Value-driven task prioritization
- High-level monitoring and goal tracking
- Integration with external business systems

It delegates specific development tasks to [Automated-Dev-Agents](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/automated-dev-agents) and uses [Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture) for memory persistence.

## Core Framework

### Value Optimization
- Self-improving systems with automated testing
- Intent preservation in LLM operations
- n8n.io pipeline efficiency

### Implementation Approach
- Prioritize tasks by value/risk/time metrics
- Deploy incremental improvements
- Maintain comprehensive monitoring

### Risk Management
- Regular validation and logging
- Incremental feature deployment
- System architecture reviews

## Architecture

The system architecture follows these design patterns:
- Observer (system analysis)
- Strategy (task prioritization)
- Chain of Responsibility (intent checks)
- Factory (agent creation)

For a detailed view of the system architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Technology

Orchestrate-AI is built with:
- Node.js
- n8n.io for workflow automation
- Redis for data caching
- Integration with AI services

## Current Status

This project is in pre-alpha stage. The core framework and architectural concepts have been established, but implementation is conceptual and untested. Key components that need development include:

- Implementation of the core workflow engine
- Integration with MTMA for memory operations
- API for interfacing with ADCA
- Monitoring and feedback mechanisms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or higher
- Redis database
- n8n.io installed and configured

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and update it with your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration values
```

### Running the System

```bash
npm run start
```
