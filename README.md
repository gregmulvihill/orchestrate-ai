# Orchestrate-AI

An orchestrated AI system for accelerating project development through self-improving infrastructure.

## Overview

Orchestrate-AI is designed as a self-improving infrastructure that rapidly iterates on both technology and business strategy. By establishing an early revenue stream, it aims to create a sustainable engine for growth, ensuring long-term success in the evolving AI landscape.

## Core Framework

### Value Optimization
- Self-improving systems with automated testing
- Intent preservation in LLM operations
- n8n.io pipeline efficiency

### Implementation Approach
- Prioritize tasks by value/risk/time metrics
- Deploy incremental improvements
- Maintain comprehensive monitoring

### Risk Management
- Regular validation and logging
- Incremental feature deployment
- System architecture reviews

## Architecture

The system architecture follows these design patterns:
- Observer (system analysis)
- Strategy (task prioritization)
- Chain of Responsibility (intent checks)
- Factory (agent creation)

For a detailed view of the system architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
