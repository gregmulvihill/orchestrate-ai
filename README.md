# Orchestrate-AI

An orchestrated AI system for accelerating project development through self-improving infrastructure.

## Overview

Orchestrate-AI is designed as a self-improving infrastructure that rapidly iterates on both technology and business strategy. By establishing an early revenue stream, it aims to create a sustainable engine for growth, ensuring long-term success in the evolving AI landscape.

Orchestrate-AI serves as the top-level strategic component in a larger AI ecosystem:
- It directs [Automated-Dev-Agents (ADCA)](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/automated-dev-agents) for tactical execution
- It leverages [Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture (MTMA)](https://github.com/gregmulvihill/multi-tiered-memory-architecture) for persistence and knowledge

## Ecosystem Architecture

Orchestrate-AI operates as the top strategic layer in a three-tier architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ORCHESTRATE-AI (THIS REPO)                      │
│ (Strategic Orchestration & Business Logic)      │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ AUTOMATED-DEV-AGENTS                            │
│ (Tactical Task Execution & Agent Management)    │
└────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┘
                         │
┌────────────────────────▼────────────────────────┐
│ MULTI-TIERED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE                │
│ (Persistence, Context Preservation, Knowledge)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Core Framework

### Value Optimization
- Self-improving systems with automated testing
- Intent preservation in LLM operations
- n8n.io pipeline efficiency

### Implementation Approach
- Prioritize tasks by value/risk/time metrics
- Deploy incremental improvements
- Maintain comprehensive monitoring

### Risk Management
- Regular validation and logging
- Incremental feature deployment
- System architecture reviews

## Architecture

The system architecture follows these design patterns:
- Observer (system analysis)
- Strategy (task prioritization)
- Chain of Responsibility (intent checks)
- Factory (agent creation)

For a detailed view of the system architecture, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Integration Points

### Integration with ADCA
Orchestrate-AI directs the Automated-Dev-Agents system by:
- Providing high-level strategic direction
- Creating prioritized development tasks
- Consuming results and evaluating output
- Adapting strategy based on development progress

### Integration with MTMA
Orchestrate-AI leverages the Multi-Tiered Memory Architecture by:
- Storing strategic knowledge for long-term planning
- Maintaining persistent state across sessions
- Accessing historical data for trend analysis
- Supporting continuity in complex workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or higher
- Redis database
- n8n.io installed and configured

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Configuration

Copy the example configuration file and update it with your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration values
```

### Running the System

```bash
npm run start
```
